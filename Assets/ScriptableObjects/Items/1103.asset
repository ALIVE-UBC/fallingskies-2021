  ItemDescription: "The red-headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) is a small
    or medium-sized woodpecker from temperate North America. Their breeding habitat
    is open country across southern Canada and the eastern-central United States.
    \r\n\r\nThese birds fly to catch insects in the air or on the ground, forage
    on trees or gather and store nuts. They nest in a cavity in a dead tree or a
    dead part of a tree. Population declines have resulted in the bird's threatened
    status. Factors suggested for population declines include: loss of overall habitat
    and standing dead wood required for nest sites and limitations of food supply."
