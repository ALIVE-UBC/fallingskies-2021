  ItemDescription: "The Sugar Factory Report reveals that the Village Council approved
    the factory for sugar beet production. Checkerboard Farms is one of the region\u2019s
    suppliers of sugar beets.\r\n\r\nThe factory uses a considerable amount of water
    during production and, as a result, generates what s called \u201Csugar mill
    effluent.\u201D This effluent requires a lot of processing to be clean enough
    to be put back into the river. If not, effluent runoff can have a burnt-sugar-like
    odour, a high pH, a high level of suspended solids, other nutrients, and heavy
    metals that may cause algae blooms."
