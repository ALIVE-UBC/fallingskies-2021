  Title: Investigate the ecological issue
  TitlePendingSubmission: Report back to Dr. Ada Lovelace
  Description: "There are some possible explanations as to what is causing the red-headed
    woodpeckers to die off. But you will need to do some fieldwork around WARBLER
    HILL to collect evidence and then return to the lab to examine that evidence.
    \r\n\nOnce you have found enough evidence to support what you think is happening,
    then you come back and tell Dr. Ada Lovelace."
